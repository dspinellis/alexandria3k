## Alexandria3k

The _alexandria3k_ package supplies a library and a command-line tool
providing efficient relational query access to the following
large scientific publication open data sets.
Data are decompressed on the fly, thus allowing the package's use even on
storage-restricted laptops.

* [Crossref](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02926-y)
  (157 GB compressed, 1 TB uncompressed).
  This contains publication metadata from about 134 million publications from
  all major international publishers with full citation data for 60 million
  of them.
* [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
  (43 GB compressed, 327 GB uncompressed).
  This comprises more than 36 million citations
  for biomedical literature from
  [MEDLINE](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medline/medline_overview.html),
  life science journals, and online books,
  with rich domain-specific metadata,
  such as [MeSH](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html) indexing,
  funding, genetic, and chemical details.
* [ORCID summary data set](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006897394-How-do-I-get-the-public-data-file-)
  (25 GB compressed, 435 GB uncompressed).
  This contains about 78 million author details records.
* [DataCite](https://datacite.org/)
  (22 GB compressed, 197 GB uncompressed).
  This comprises research outputs and resources,
  such as data, pre-prints, images, and samples,
  containing about 50 million work entries.
* [United States Patent Office issued patents](https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/)
  (11 GB compressed, 115 GB uncompressed).
  This  containins about 5.4 million records.

Further supported data sets include
funder bodies,
journal names,
open access journals,
and research organizations.

The _alexandria3k_ package installation contains all elements required
to run it.
It does not require the installation, configuration, and maintenance
of a third party relational or graph database.
It can therefore be used out-of-the-box for performing reproducible
publication research on the desktop.
