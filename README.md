## Alexandria3k

<!-- INTRO-BEGIN -->

The _alexandria3k_ Python package supplies a command-line tool and an API
providing fast and space-efficient relational query access to the following
large scientific publication open data sets.
Data are decompressed on the fly, thus allowing the package's use even on
storage-restricted laptops.
The _alexandria3k_ package supports the following large data sets.

* [Crossref](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02926-y)
  (184 GiB compressed,
  1.9 TiB uncompressed â€” as of March 2025).
  This contains publication metadata from all major international publishers.
  The Crossref data set is split into about 33 thousand files.
  Each file contains JSON data for 5000 publications (works).
  In total, Crossref contains data for 167 million works,
  35 million abstracts, 465 million associated work authors,
  and 2.5 billion references.

* [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
  (47 GiB compressed, 707 GiB uncompressed â€” as of April 2025).
  This comprises more than 36 million citations
  for biomedical literature from
  [MEDLINE](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medline/medline_overview.html),
  life science journals, and online books,
  with rich domain-specific metadata,
  such as [MeSH](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html) indexing,
  funding, genetic, and chemical details.
<!--. gzip -l * | awk '{s += $2}END{print s, s / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 }' -->

* [ORCID summary data set](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006897394-How-do-I-get-the-public-data-file-)
  (37 GiB compressed, 651 GiB uncompressed â€” as of October 2024).
  This contains about 22 million author details records.
<!-- tar tzvf ORCID_2024_10_summaries.tar.gz | wc -l -->

* [DataCite](https://datacite.org/)
  (24 GiB compressed, 347 GiB uncompressed â€” as of 2024).
  This comprises research outputs and resources,
  such as data, pre-prints, images, and samples,
  containing about 50 million work entries.

* [United States Patent Office issued patents](https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/)
  (12 GiB compressed, 128 GiB uncompressed â€” as of January 2025).
  This  contains about 5.4 million records.
<!-- find . -name \*.zip | xargs -n 1 unzip -v | awk '/files$/{ s+= $1}END{print s, s / 1024 / 1024 / 1024}' -->

Further supported data sets include
funder bodies,
journal names,
open access journals,
and research organizations.

The _alexandria3k_ package installation contains all elements required
to run it.
It does not require the installation, configuration, and maintenance
of a third party relational or graph database.
It can therefore be used out-of-the-box for performing reproducible
publication research on the desktop.

Databases populated with _alexandria3k_ can be used by generative AI
applications through the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) and its
[SQLite](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/sqlite)
reference server.
Application examples include
topic modeling,
snowballing,
trend analysis,
author disambiguation,
citation graph generation,
research trend analysis,
patent similarity detection,
grant and funding prediction,
co-authorship network mapping,
institutional collaboration analysis,
knowledge graph augmentation,
research impact prediction,
academic fraud detection,
technology transfer mapping,
interdisciplinary research discovery, and
research paper recommendations.
