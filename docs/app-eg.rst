Application examples
====================

The source distribution ``examples`` directory contains proof-of-concept
studies that were conducted with *alexandria3k* as examples of its use.

They are structured to use Makefiles based on
`simple-rolap <https://github.com/dspinellis/simple-rolap>`__ for
orchestrating the queries (it is installed automatically) and
`rdbunit <https://github.com/dspinellis/rdbunit>`__ for unit testing
them (it needs to be manually installed for running the tests). Running
(GNU) ``make`` in a directory will produce the expected results in a
``reports`` sub-directory. Many of the studies can take hours or days to
run. When running the scripts on a shared Unix/Linux computer, running
*make* as ``nohup nice make`` will log the operation in the file
``nohup.out`` (use ``tail -f nohup.out`` to view it), prevent the
command from terminating when a session is disconnected, and decrease
the priority of the tasks to minimize their burden on interactive users.
When modifying existing studies or creating one ones, run ``make help``
in a study directory to see some potentially useful *make* targets.

The
`common <https://github.com/dspinellis/alexandria3k/tree/main/examples/common>`__
directory contains Makefile rules for satisfying data dependencies
common to more than one study. It also hosts downloaded data sets to
minimize useless replication. The ``Makefile`` residing in it can be
used to tailor the running of all other studies.
