Alexandria3k documentation
==========================

The *alexandria3k* package supplies a library and a command-line tool
providing efficient relational query access to diverse publication open
data sets.
The most important one is the entire `Crossref data
set <https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02926-y>`__ (157 GB
compressed, 1 TB uncompressed). This contains publication metadata from
about 134 million publications from all major international publishers
with full citation data for 60 million of them.
In addition, the Crossref data set can be linked with the `ORCID summary
data
set <https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006897394-How-do-I-get-the-public-data-file->`__
(25 GB compressed, 435 GB uuncompressed), containing about 78 million
author records, as well as data sets of funder bodies, journal names,
open access journals, and research organizations.

The *alexandria3k*
package installation contains all elements required to run it. It does
not require the installation, configuration, and maintenance of a third
party relational or graph database. It can therefore be used
out-of-the-box for performing reproducible publication research on the
desktop.
