In addition,
direct SQL queries can be performed on each data source's tables.
Queries involving multiple scans of the tables (e.g.Â relational joins)
should be performed by directing *alexandria3k* to perform them
separately in each partition. This however means that aggregation
operations will not work as expected, because they will be run multiple
times (once for every partition).
